### Calculator for Vex Robotics' Tower Takeover

Inspired by [Walshbot's Tower Takeover Scoring Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y6cIgPTXV6TxAmUUEhi0BIb9Mq3QNr47fIzttS-Qa0M/edit#gid=1549206126), Team 2616-N made their own version on the TI-84 CE with improved input, features, and graphics for use in Vex Robotics' Tower Takeover.

This project is built off of [Mateoconlechuga's toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain) to build C programs for TI-84 CE / TI-83 Premium CE calculators.
